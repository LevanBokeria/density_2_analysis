sub_58,Instructions were super clear with a good level of detail,I was judging based on the overall shape and the curves of the object,I felt like i had enough time to respond,"Interesting study, encouraged me to concentrate and compare the shapes thoroughly","Clear instructions, super helpful",I felt like i had enough time to respond without feeling time pressures,N/A
sub_59,no,i was watching the curves on the items and whether they curved in or out,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub_60,no,usually by how curvey or straight an object was. sometimes the direction the curve was going,maybe another second would help,no,no,yes,no
sub_61,None,The closest in terms of shape,yes,None,None,Yes,No
sub_62,No,Mostly focused on the end - how pointed/rounded it was and the edges (how curved),Yes ,No,No,Yes,None
sub_63,No,One that looked mostly the same when glancing,Yes,No,No,Yes,No
sub_64,No,I just looked at the outline and the sides and curves,Yes but i think i was conscious of missing them so i think maybe if i slowed down more i might have got a higher percentage,No. I thought it would be easy judging from the trial. and i thought i could easily get 85 percent plus. It was harder than i thought,No ,Yes,No
sub_65,no,how curvy the curves are and the shadows,yes,n/a,no,yes,n/a
sub_66,no,by te look of their corners,yes,no,no,yes,the lentghier the experiment the hader it was for me to distinquish differences
sub_67,no,looking at the lighter purple triangle,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub_68,"No, it was all very clear and simple to understand",I tried to look at the shape of the darker edges and assess their similarity.,"Yes, on most occasions I did",No,"Again, all very simple and clear","Yes, enough time most of the time",No
sub_69,no clear instructions were provided,how closest i felt it was ,yes,n/a,no,yes,n/a
sub_70,No,I decided which one looked more different and chose the other one,For the most part,No,No,Yes,No
sub_71,No,I looked for similar shapes in the base,I would have preferred more time to be sure of my decision,No,No,I tried to remember the shape of the left section of the base,No
sub_72,no,shape/curvature and depth of shape that could be seen ,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub_73,it was clear,tried to look for the shape which looked most like it,most of the time but sometimes could have done with more time,nope,i found it clear,i could have done with a bit more time of a few of them which looked similar to one another,nope
sub_74,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub_75,No,Mainly just instinct,Barely,no,No,Yes,no
sub_76,"No, I just felt very uneasy and had too much energy to keep my focus on the task at times.","I used the curves on the objects, and the shapes of them.","Yes and no, some were quite difficult.",No,No,"Yes and no, some were difficult.",No
sub_77,"No, not at all.",going through the object's shape ,"Yes, I did.",na,"No, not at all.","Yes, I did.",na
sub_78,"No, nothing was unclear, only that a pic of all the different shapes that were different the triangle spade etc. to help clarify the different shapes.",I went mostly with my gut in which I felt looked closer to the target.,"I guess so, not having a timer felt like I had to pick sooner than I probably had to, but ",I mentioned near the start of the task that a timer between each would have been nice to prepare position fingers etc. especially the similarity tasks as they loaded and started pretty quickly compared to Same/Different task.,"I did feel a little confused. You wrote the word exactly the same... only most weren't the same. They often looked similar, but they were slightly different in size or angle, very rarely exactly the same. I felt like a picture of or a number of how many shapes we were comparing would have helped before doing it to clarify meant to be comparable. IF that makes sense?","Again, I guess so... I think having too much time can be an hindrance.",Not that I can think of that I haven't covered above.
sub_79,no,a quick glance to see what looked as similar ,yes,nothing,no,yes,no
sub_80,no,looked at how much different they were,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub_81,"no, everything clear",intuition; there wasn't enough time to really think about it,sometimes the shape difference was so subtle i started to think and possibly ran out of time - not sure if i pressed the button just in time or if i missed out,none that i can think of,"no, everything clear",yes,none that i can think of
sub_82,no it was just very ticky,i tried to see which had the closest shado,a second or two more would of been helpful,i was harder then i thought it would be ,no,no,i kept getting muddled on the keys not because i didnt understand which was which but because it was fast paced and i kept tripping up on it 
sub_83,no it was clear,"I compared angles, looked at the amount of darker area visible, and at the shape of the curve on each object",yes there was sufficient time,It was quite difficult at times as some were very similar,the instructions were clear,yes,Some of the objects were very similar so it was hard to say if they were exactly the same 
sub_84,no,I looked at the curves and straight lines and tried to match them up with the target object.,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub_85,"No, the instructions were clear.","I looked at the overall shape to see if there was straight, convex or concave edges and also the form of the shadowed edges.","Yes, I feel I had enough time but I  would have been more accurate with a bit more time.",I was surprised by my accuracy score not being as high as I thought it would be.,"No, the instructions were clear.","Yes, I felt I had ample time.",This felt like an easier task than the similarity task.
sub_86,no,"follow my intuition, sometimes I focused more on the right hand side edge/shadow",Not for all trials,No,No,Yes,No
sub_87,Everything was clear.,"Tried to quickly look at the two on the left and the right, comparing the distinguishing features, convex or concave generally.",It depended on the trial. Some where they were all similar it was not quite enough time to compare all three.,No further feedback.,"No, everything was clear.",I think there was enough time in this task.,No further feedback.
