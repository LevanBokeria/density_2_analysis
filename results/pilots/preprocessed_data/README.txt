NOTE:
The subject notation here refers to the old way of mapping prolific IDs to anonymous IDs. We've since changed this. 

Pilot paradigm 1: 
dimension was 30-118
sub_01 - sub_16

Pilot paradigm 2: 
dimension was 30-110
sub_16 - sub_30

Pilot paradigm 3:
dimension was 30-110
also presented low density exemplars during exposure
sub_31 - sub_57

Experiment 1:
dimensions were 30-110
This was the main experiment with Bayes analysis.
sub_58 - sub_196
