sub_29,No it was pretty clear. ,I judged by the size and how close of a similarity of the shape's curvature. ,Just about enough time to make a choice.,None.,It was clear until the experiment started.

sub_35,"No, I understood it all fine!",I tried to judge based on how curvy and pointy each object was and went with the option I thought was most similar to the target object based on a mix of both of these,I did but I missed the first trial a couple of times so maybe more time on the first trial until we get our bearings if possible,"No, I enjoyed this task overall","No, I understood it all fine!",Yes I did,"I enjoyed this task also, well put together and I liked that you asked about technical issues after each one too!"

sub_59,no,i was watching the curves on the items and whether they curved in or out,yes,no,no,yes,no

sub_63,No,One that looked mostly the same when glancing,Yes,No,No,Yes,No
sub_64,No,I just looked at the outline and the sides and curves,Yes but i think i was conscious of missing them so i think maybe if i slowed down more i might have got a higher percentage,No. I thought it would be easy judging from the trial. and i thought i could easily get 85 percent plus.

sub_74,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub_75,No,Mainly just instinct,Barely,no,No,Yes,no

sub_77,"No, not at all.",going through the object's shape ,"Yes, I did.",na,"No, not at all.","Yes, I did.",na
sub_78,"No, nothing was unclear, only that a pic of all the different shapes that were different the triangle spade etc. to help clarify the different shapes.",I went mostly with my gut in which I felt looked closer to the target.,"I guess so, not having a timer felt like I had to pick sooner than I probably had to, but ",I mentioned near the start of the task that a timer between each would have been nice to prepare position fingers etc. especially the similarity tasks as they loaded and started pretty quickly compared to Same/Different task.,"I did feel a little confused. You wrote the word exactly the same... only most weren't the same. They often looked similar, but they were slightly different in size or angle, very rarely exactly the same. I felt like a picture of or a number of how many shapes we were comparing would have helped before doing it to clarify meant to be comparable. IF that makes sense?","Again, I guess so... I think having too much time can be an hindrance.",Not that I can think of that I haven't covered above.
sub_79,no,a quick glance to see what looked as similar ,yes,nothing,no,yes,no
sub_80,no,looked at how much different they were,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub_81,"no, everything clear",intuition; there wasn't enough time to really think about it,sometimes the shape difference was so subtle i started to think and possibly ran out of time - not sure if i pressed the button just in time or if i missed out,none that i can think of,"no, everything clear",yes,none that i can think of
sub_82,no it was just very ticky,i tried to see which had the closest shado,a second or two more would of been helpful,i was harder then i thought it would be ,no,no,i kept getting muddled on the keys not because i didnt understand which was which but because it was fast paced and i kept tripping up on it 
sub_83,no it was clear,"I compared angles, looked at the amount of darker area visible, and at the shape of the curve on each object",yes there was sufficient time,It was quite difficult at times as some were very similar,the instructions were clear,yes,Some of the objects were very similar so it was hard to say if they were exactly the same 
sub_84,no,I looked at the curves and straight lines and tried to match them up with the target object.,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub_85,"No, the instructions were clear.","I looked at the overall shape to see if there was straight, convex or concave edges and also the form of the shadowed edges.","Yes, I feel I had enough time but I  would have been more accurate with a bit more time.",I was surprised by my accuracy score not being as high as I thought it would be.,"No, the instructions were clear.","Yes, I felt I had ample time.",This felt like an easier task than the similarity task.
sub_86,no,"follow my intuition, sometimes I focused more on the right hand side edge/shadow",Not for all trials,No,No,Yes,No
sub_87,Everything was clear.,"Tried to quickly look at the two on the left and the right, comparing the distinguishing features, convex or concave generally.",It depended on the trial. Some where they were all similar it was not quite enough time to compare all three.,No further feedback.,"No, everything was clear.",I think there was enough time in this task.,No further feedback.
sub_88,no,depending on the more rounded or sharp shape,no,noo,no,no,no
sub_89,no,no,yes,was ok,no,yes,was quite ok
sub_90,Everything was clear,I began looking to the lower right hand angle to determine the overall shape,Would have liked a little more time for each trial ,N/A,Everything was clear,Would have liked perhaps a second more per trial ,N//A
sub_91,No,I looked at the edges,"Yes, too much in most cases",No,No,"Yes, too long, in fact",No
sub_92,no everything was clear,i looked closely and made a decision based on shape,yes i did,i found it very interesting thank you,no everything was clear,yes i did,none thanks
sub_93,no,From consideration,Yes,None,No,Yes,None
sub_94,No all good,curve and circumference,no,no,no all good,yes,no
sub_95,no,just tried to look at it quickly and judge which was the same,just about,no,no,could have perhaps done with a bit longer,no
sub_96,no,"chose whichever looked most similar in terms of the curve, size etc",yes,n/a,no,yes,n/a
sub_97,no,i tried to follow the shape lines as best I could,yes,the pictures did not load a lot of the time making it impossible for me to do well.,no,yes,the pictures did not load a lot of the time making it impossible for me to do well.
sub_98,no,i tried to focus on the shape made by the shaded faces,yes,nothing to add,no,yes,nothing to add
sub_99,No,"Judging the shape, if it was more similar","Mostly, yes. Could have done with more time.",No,No,"Mostly, yes, but could have done with more time.",No
