You wrote the word exactly the same... only most weren't the same. They often looked similar, but they were slightly different in size or angle, very rarely exactly the same.

Most of the time for example, if a normal triangle was curved inwards slightly then I'd go with the one that was a shield as the most similar object. But if the triangle was curved outwards slightly, then I'd make the decision that it was more similar to the curved outwards triangles. ","In some cases yes, but in a few cases I was too slow and made clumsy decisions. A second or two longer would have made me much more accurate I think.

sub150,experiment_1,dense_left,Not at all,Depended on the pointedness/roundness of the triangle. ,No - I did panic and pressed the wrong buttons at times where I was aware,These tasks were easier than the others,No but I do believe there should have been a practice,"No, I also panic clicked a lot more in this trial",This tested quite confusing at times
sub151,experiment_1,dense_left,np. ,I looked at the corners and the shape of the object.,yes.,no.,no.,yes.,no.
sub152,experiment_1,dense_right,No. The instructions were clear.,I looked at the overall shapes and picked the one I thought was the most similar to the target shape.,I would have been more accurate if I had more time to compare the shapes. ,A few times I picked a shape and then thought instantly that I had made a mistake on closer viewing. Having to make a quick assessment was the hardest part of the task. ,No,Yes,It was easier than the similarity task but sometimes I wasn't sure if the shape was the same or slightly different.
sub153,experiment_1,dense_right,No everything was clear!,"A lot looked very similar, so i tried to focus on the outline/edge of the shape.",Yeah more than enough.,Was fun!,No everything was fine.,Yeah.,"Was challenging, but fun!"
sub155,experiment_1,dense_left,"The criteria for judging the similiarity was unclear, some shapes I think were equally similiar.","I prioritised the sharpness/smoothness of the edges, the more rounded shapes being more similiar even if they were slightly triangular.",Yes,There is a delay after pressing the p or q key that makes the task feel slow.,No.,Yes,Same feedback as above- feels like there is a delay after choosing either p or q
sub156,experiment_1,dense_left,"no, not at all",I suppose intuition and based on looking at them and thinking which one looks like it needs to be the least modified to get to the middle shape. ,yes,can't think of anything,"no, very clear","yes, seemed fine maybe a bit trickier simply because it took a while to get used to different task ","no, thanks for letting me participate :)"
sub157,experiment_1,dense_right,no,i look at the curves and compare,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub158,experiment_1,dense_right,Nothing was unclear thank you for providing clear instructions,"I tried to look at the top of the shape first, but if they were all too similar i then looked at the bottom of the shape to see a more noticeable difference",Yes but on some where they looked very similar I panicked and pressed the wrong one and immediately after realised i had selected the wrong one,On some where they looked very similar I panicked and pressed the wrong one and immediately after realised i had selected the wrong one,Nothing was unclear thank you for providing clear instructions,Yes but on some where they looked very similar I panicked and pressed the wrong one and immediately after realised i had selected the wrong one,On some where they looked very similar I panicked and pressed the wrong one and immediately after realised i had selected the wrong one
sub159,experiment_1,dense_right,no,used intuition,yes,no,no,yes,no
sub160,experiment_1,dense_left,No.,I quickly glanced at each of them to the left and right.,"Just about, but it was close when they were all similar.",None.,No.,Not really. It was difficult sometimes.,My task 2 was faulty as not all the images loaded.
sub161,experiment_1,dense_right,"To begin with I thought it meant one of the two options would be the same as the middle, but it quickly became clear it was just whichever was most similar.",By paying attention to how curved the sides were,Yes,No,No,Yes,No
sub162,experiment_1,dense_left,No.,I tried to focus on the bottom part/base of the object but it was really difficult.,Yes,It was quite difficult and I was surprised I did progressively worse as the trials went on,No.,Yes,I was also surprised by how difficult and how badly I did even though I focused and concentrated on it really hard.
sub163,experiment_1,dense_right,No,I just quickly looked at both options and went with my first opinion on which was more similar.,Yes,No,No,Yes,No
sub165,experiment_1,dense_left,No,"I tried to choose based on the general shape of the top, or in the case of the triangles, how curved the edges were",Barely,None,No,Barely,No
sub166,experiment_1,dense_right,No,By the edges of the shape,Yes,No,No,Yes,No
sub167,experiment_1,dense_left,No! :),"It was a combination of intuition / initial reaction, and looking at how concave/convex (fat/thin) the triangles were.","Just enough, usually, unless they were very similar in which case I felt quite pressed for time.",No! :),No! :),"Again, usually yes, but if my initial reaction was ""this looks really similar but _slightly_ different, maybe"" then my brain wanted a few more seconds to remember and think, so I felt a bit pressed for time.",No! :)
sub168,experiment_1,dense_right,no,By eye - jsut tried to look at both objects and select one,not always,no,no,yes,no
sub170,experiment_1,dense_right,No,Went for the nearest shape - whether it had straight lines or not,Yes,No,No,Yes,No
sub172,experiment_1,dense_left,Nothing was unclear.,I looked at the target object in the middle and chose the object which looked more similar to it in the time frame given.,A few more seconds would have made my decisions more accurate.,Nothing else comes to mind.,"No, everything was crystal clear.","No, I would have liked a bit more time as I would have performed much better than I did.","No, I have nothing more to add."
sub173,experiment_1,dense_right,no,By comparing the shapes,Failry so,No,no,no,no
sub174,experiment_1,dense_left,No.,"By observing the shape, Specially the edges.","yes,",I think it was easy to find the similar shapes.,No,"I missed 2-3 trials because of short time. But, rest it was okay.",TO choose same and different was a bit difficult.
sub175,experiment_1,dense_right,No nothing was unclear,I looked at the general shape and went with what my first instinct of the more similar was. I didn't realise until I did the same/different task that there were a few variations of the similar shapes and I was able to identify some of the differences. ,Yes I had enough time but I did feel like some of my responses may have been different if I was able to examine the comparisons a bit more. ,No other feedback thank you ,No nothing was unclear,Yes I had enough time for each. I found myself feeling more confident towards the end of the trials as I learnt more about the shapes. ,No other feedback thank you 
sub176,experiment_1,dense_right,no,look at middle then compare right and left,yes,no,no,most of the time,no
sub177,experiment_1,dense_left,All clear,Sometimes it was obvious because they were almost identical. Other times i looked at how much of  a curve there was and which way it bent.,yes,SOme of them were very close in shape,no,yes,THe different ones were surprisingly hard to spot

sub187,experiment_1,dense_left,no,"overall impression of shape, sometimes the leading edge ","sometimes, although I felt as the rounds went on I had seen so many shapes I naturally hesitated and required longer.",none,no,"sometimes, same as similarity tasks in that I hesitated more as time passed.",no
sub188,experiment_1,dense_right,No,Size of shape and direction of its curves.,Yes,No,No,Yes,I think I was struggling to identify differences between shapes. Some of the differences were really slight.
sub189,experiment_1,dense_right,No,I tried to pick the object that was curved in the same direction as the central one. If the central object was straight then I picked the less distorted of the two,Yes but I would have liked more and the limit did stress me a little,No,No,"Same as above, I had enough time but I would have liked more and the limit did stress me a little",No
sub190,experiment_1,dense_right,no,it's hard to explain in words but I thought about how much you would have to change the middle shape in order to turn it into the left or right shape and judged the similarity based on that,"no, the time pressure made it very difficult to judge accurately",no,no,"no, the time pressure made it very difficult",no
sub191,experiment_1,dense_left,No.,"I looked for similarities in the shaded part of each shape, this helped me see which was more similar to the target.",Just about.,No.,No.,Yes.,No.

sub195,experiment_1,dense_left,"No, the instructions were clear and the trial was helpful in understanding the task.","At first I tried to look at the whole shape and judge the corners but by the final round I adopted another strategy and was trying to judge how concave/convex the edge closest to me was, and comparing those. ",Yes,"No, thank you.","I misunderstood the task initially, thinking I had to see a 'control' image and then compare it with the image I had to judge, then see a new 'control' image and then compare etc. - sorry I messed up there! By the second round I got the hang of it. It would have helped to have a trial run and feedback to explain I was getting it wrong. ",It was fine.,"Not really. As mentioned, having a practice round to let me get a feel for the task would have helped."
